# T9 assignment

Implement a number to word list converter as a Node backend and React/Redux fronted.

The backend should provide a rest endpoint that converts a given numeric string into a list of corresponding words in the style of T9 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)] or Phonewords [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneword]. For example, given the input 23 the output should be: ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf

The frontend should allow the user to enter a number, query the backend for the corresponding expansions, and display them.

The solution should be shared with us in a git repository, preferably with real history included.

Ways to go beyond the minimal solution could include for example:
- phone keyboard -like UI
- great project setup
- mobile app in React Native
- filtering to include only real words based on a suitable word list
